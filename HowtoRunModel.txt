To run your AI sentiment analysis script (nltk_engine.py) so it can process your database feedback, follow these precise steps.

1. Install Python and Required Libraries
Before the script can talk to your MySQL database or perform AI analysis, you must install the necessary "engines.".

Open your Command Prompt (cmd) or Terminal.

Type the following command and press Enter: pip install textblob mysql-connector-python.

Crucial for TextBlob: You also need to download the English language corpora by running this command: python -m textblob.download_corpora

2. Navigate to your Project Folder
You need to tell your computer exactly where the file is located. Based on your folder structure:

In your terminal, type D: and press Enter (to switch to your D drive).

Navigate to your sentiment folder: cd "D:\project imp\htdocs\Team-Echo\sentiment"

3. Execute the Script
Now, run the script to start the analysis process:

Type the following and press Enter: python nltk_engine.py

4. Verify the Results in MySQL
Once the script says "Analysis Complete," go to phpMyAdmin to see the "AI" in action:

Open your team_echo_new database.

Open the feedback table.

Check the sentiment_label column. It should no longer be NULL; it will now show Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on the feedback_text..
